Notes
OAuth 2.0 Authentication: The authenticate_tiktok() function is a placeholder. You will need to implement the OAuth 2.0 flow to obtain an access token from TikTok.

Nextcloud Video Retrieval: The fetch_video_from_nextcloud() function assumes a JSON response from the Nextcloud API. Adjust this based on your Nextcloud setup.

Posting to TikTok: The post_video_to_tiktok() function is also a placeholder. Implement the actual logic for posting videos to TikTok.

Error Handling: This code lacks robust error handling and logging. Implement error handling for API requests and other critical operations.

Scheduling: The bot is set to run every day at 9 AM. You can adjust the schedule as needed.
